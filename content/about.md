## Kia ora!

Hey there, I'm Matt; I'm a software engineer, pilot, and adventurer. I'm currently based between Auckland, and Queenstown, New Zealand.

I like to dabble in (and occasionally write about) topics such as C#, Rust, software architecture, OOP patterns, systems programming, and language design.

When I'm not losing myself in the neon glow of the computer screen, you'll often find me  hanging off a cliff face up a mountain somewhere, throwing myself off said cliff on a paraglider, or out paddling my sea kayak.

I love a good coconut flat white and a cringe-worthy 'Dad joke', so if that sounds like a bit of you, please do [get in touch](mailto:matt@mattchapman.io)!

Matt.
