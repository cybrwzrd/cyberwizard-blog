In this post we'll learn about binary, hex, and decimal numbering systems. We'll learn what a 'base' is, as well as how to convert between different bases. We'll also look at why these different number systems are so useful, and some of their most common use cases.

## What's in a base?

### Decimal (base 10)

### Binary (base 2)

### HexaDecimal (base 16)
