In this post we'll learn about binary, hex, and decimal numbering systems. We'll learn what a 'base' is, as well as how to convert between different bases. We'll also look at why these different number systems are so useful, and some of their most common use cases.

## What's in a base?

> In a positional numeral system, the radix or base is **the number of unique digits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers**.

Um, thanks Wikipedia. Not the most enlightening is it? Simply put, a "base" is the _base set_ of **digits** that you can use to represent numbers. So, binary is base 2. The only two digits used to represent numbers in binary are 1s and 0s. Easy right?

### Decimal (base 10)

Decimal, or base 10, is what you're probably used to dealing with on a daily basis. There are 10 digits used to represent decimal numbers:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The handy thing about decimal is that working in groups of 10 makes for nice easy math, as we'll see shortly.

### Binary (base 2)

Binary, or base 2 is the 

### Hexadecimal (base 16)
